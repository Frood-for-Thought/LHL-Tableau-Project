# Final-Project-Tableau

#### I) FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015: 
This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. 
Visit the FAA Wildlife Strike Database which contains records of wildlife strikes reported by 
airlines, airports, pilots, and other sources. 
The dataset is available here as [faa_data_subset.xlsx]
(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-tOmmtGtiY_3XMnYtVblDhlj_kzLBxa/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108445376648788204707&rtpof=true&sd=true.)

Follow the steps below:

1. Connect your data
2. Detect different data types in your data
3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset
4. There are three main different categorical features in the table. Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends. 
  - Effect 
  - When
  - Wildlife
5. In your final project you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Date and time
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, 
come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project.
9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard 

Submission Guidelines:

For this project, you will need to submit a link to your github repo that contains all of the files listed. The files submitted will be evaluated.

Your repo must include the following:

    Include one PDF file with your presentation. It should be named 
	
	TableauPresentation_Option2_faa_data_subset_Frood_Michael.PDF
	
        Make sure you list if you either addressed Option 1 or 2 in the title in the OptionNumber part of the PDF name.
        Make sure to name the dataset you selected for the Dataset part of the title of the file if you are completing Option 2.
    The presentation should include the visualizations and key takeaways from your investigation (follow the Presentation Guidelines section on this page for further information).
    One Worksheet (in .twb format) with your dashboards/visualizations you created.


Presentation Guidelines:

    Spend 1 min on project flow structure. What were the steps in your project?
    Spend 1-2 minutes showing your results. Make sure to highlight:
        For Option 1, share the visualizations that you produced in response to the questions.
        For Option 2, please share what your main data question was, what you wanted to answer, the dataset you selected, and then explain some of the features of the dataset as well.
    Explain the biggest challenges in 1 min.
        What would you do if you had a bit more time?
    In your presentation, make sure to explain the rationale for the visualizations you selected for either Option 1 or 2.


## Project/Goals
Find a relationship between time, species, location, number of strikes, cost, damage, and trends.
Determine if there are any outliers.

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
